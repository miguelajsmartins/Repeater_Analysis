This analysis pipeline compares the sensitivity of Lambda against that of the number of events per target bin in a very simple setting:

Only 1 target is considered. An event is simply a time stamp over the observation time of an experiment. 

N events are simulated when Mu are expected. 

Lambda is computed for many realizations of N events with different timmings. 

The Lambda distribution is built for each value of N. 

A flare is introduced and Lambda is computed for it. Flare parameters, like the number of events per flare and the duration of the flare, are veried in a grid, such that for each combination of the parameters, the p-value obtained with the number of events is compared with the pvalue obtained with Lambda.
